# Amazon-clone
After learning the basics of HTML and CSS I tried my first project to apply my hands on knowledge about the former.This project is an Amazon home page clone. This clone is made using HTML and CSS. This project is the clone of what we see in the amazon home page. The major concepts used in this project are flex-box and its properties, insertion of image creating appropriate divs and alternating its properties. My learning of this project include tha manipulation of proper space, the requirement of margin and padding
creating divs and spans, identifying the proper hierarchy of elements, use of appropriate fonts and colour, and lastly how to get icons in your website and using cdn. My main focus while doing this project has been the appearance I havent focused on the responsiveness of the website yet.
